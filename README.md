# Chara_Chorder ï¼ˆnon official product)
Increase your typing speed by 101% using software 

# Background
When I first heard about the invention of CharaChorder, I feel very excited to see its fast typing capability.
Also, it can reduce keystoke upto 500% (by commercial). At first, I thought charachorder is a hardware that check spelling and correct it as I type. So, I just made a autocorrect program using python. However, when I dived deeper into the principles laid behind the chords entries, I discovered that chording is just pressing on multiple keys at the same time to type a letter or word. Not to mention all chords are required to be memorized one-by-one. In other words, it just a hardware version of auto hot key (AHK) language but sold with ten thousands of pennies (USD). 

# Abstract
